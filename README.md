## PacketFrame

The PacketFrame CDN is an open source (AGPL-3.0) anycast CDN platform, currently in beta. If you're interested in an account, send an email to the address listed on the front page of https://packetframe.com or reach out in #packetframe on the [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/guides/connect) IRC network.

*In the interest of consistency and ease of development, the multiple CDN version repos are being consolodated into a single project repo at https://github.com/natesales/cdn-tree An attempt has been made to preserve the most significant revision history, but it's still a work in progress.*

#### Project Structure

```
.
├── backend # All code that runs server side
│   ├── acme # LetsEncrypt automation for ACME challenges
│   ├── provisioning # Ansible playbooks for node deployment
│   └── templates # Per-node config templates used by the orchestrator
└── frontend # Svelte dashboard (https://packetframe.com)
    ├── public
    │   └── static # Public static assets
    ├── scripts
    └── src
        └── components # Individual Svelte components
```

#### Development
The repo is designed to be tested at the service level. Each daemon or service should be able to be ran and debugged independently of the rest of the network.

#### Future
This repo contains the current production codebase for the CDN. The new v3 controlplane rewrite is under development: [cdnv3](https://github.com/natesales/cdnv3/).
